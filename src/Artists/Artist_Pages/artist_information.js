      bio: "The journey in celebrating heritage is evident in all artworks produced by Raeda Ashour. The architectural elements and depicted detail reveal a strong and confident visualization and realization of aesthetic components prevalent in Islamic art and ornamentation. Raeda was inspired by old Arabian cities, with their famous architectural and aesthetic features. She never got tired of exploring and researching the subject of what constitutes Islamic art, its beauty, mystery, philosophy and aesthetics. She became passionate and obsessed by the beauty of the area. The more she delved into the subject, the more she became engrossed in its details, and she felt more connected and proud of her own roots and heritage. Raeda specialized in miniatures, motifs and Islamic decorative units, and adapted these in a modern interpretation that can be digested by contemporary tastes, the result of which are harmonious compositions and a melody of variance in surface treatment, some embossed with beautiful soft colors that please the eye. Raeda's aim is to find aesthetic compositions and elements that she can be inspired by, emphasize and reinterpret in her own style, which makes her art unique and distinctive."

      bio: "The artist started painting in 2006 and after about one year of tests, he decided to stop in order to study the processes of interaction between colours: two enamels poured on an even support tend to blend autonomously. He realized that through this phenomenon – which he defined as “blending” – it was possible to depersonalise the product of the creative act and reach concepts that transcend reality. By employing a transparent material called “methacrylate”, the sculptor noticed that the colors blended on one side of the support. On its other side, instead, the first moment of the pictorial act remained imprinted, revealing the mark left by the colour before the process of depersonalisation. Hence, he decided to mould the painted support so that the two moments of metamorphosis could be shown and made available to the public. The artist published his first writings in a small and self released catalogue in 2009, called Il Sé Transpersonale (literally The Transpersonal Self). /n In 2011, he approached Il Metaformismo, by professor Giulia Sillato. She led him to show his work in several prestigious exhibitions held in different places, such as Chiostro del Bramante in Rome, Palazzo dei Giureconsulti in Milan and Palazzo della Gran Guardia in Verona, all combined with important publications edited by Mazzotta and Mondadori. During the same year, the sculptor wrote another text in the volume Il Metaformismo, published by Mondadori and curated by professor Giulia Sillato. In 2014, after examining in depth the critical survey on Metaforma for years, the artist published his own programmatic formulation about Seconda Forma (literally Second Form). In short, the artist declared that it is necessary to face a first phase of depersonalisation of the creative moment through a painting act in order to describe all the concepts related to the incorporeal. Then, there is a second phase of sculptural process, during which the creation is brought back to a corporeal level and becomes available to the observer."

      bio: "I used to paint murals in London and Saudi Arabia and held workshops on Trompe L'oeil painting and on fantasy and antiquing effects. I also taught drawing and painting at Darat Binzagr in Jeddah. My work is a celebration of what I find beautiful, exotic and interesting. It is a visual response to the light and how it changes the simplest and often mundane objects into fascinating forms. Without light there is no life and no joy, and that is what I paint. I want people to feel that uplifting joy and to see and appreciate what we all have in common, a need to be uplifted."

      bio: "Trudie Canwood-Kruger (Arnhem, The Netherlands, 1961) is a professional artist. As a child she used to draw, paint and sew all the time. After high school she studied textile design and interior design but for a long time she hardly used her skills professionally.  In 2003, after spending a month on the beautiful caribbean island of Curaçao, she started painting. This work, in bright effulgent colours and inspired on her mother-in-law and daily caribbean life, had an unmistakable carribbean feel. Almost immediately Canwood's painting career really takes off and in 2009 she was able to quit her part time job to become a full-time artist. Nowadays she mainly paints landscapes in a completely different style inspired on (childhood) memories, trips and holidays. “When I start painting these landscapes, most of the time I have no idea where I’m going. The work grows along the way and it’s always a struggle to decide when it’s finished”. Canwood had exhibitions in New York, London, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Aruba, Nevis and more. In 2011 for the first time a solo-exhibition was completely sold out. Her work is used for postcards, mugs, place mats, several books, packaging and art diaries etc."

      bio: "My work as an artist has been to bring light into dark places, and to explore how art helps heal mind, body and spirit. I experience daily how color and images arouse the senses, opening us to a place deeper than words. Using torn, patterned and hand-colored paper, I create vivid monotype/collage prints and let the images speak to me. My interaction with these materials and the senses they awaken are like a conversation that leads to creating the final piece. This intuitive process has also resulted in paintings, published books and murals for healthcare.  I believe that art invokes magic, both in the creator and in those who receive it. The synergy between artist and viewer can make the invisible, visible."

So, I have work my oils, water or pastels and pencils with time, and not looking to create a discord or heaviness between the space and the story I have dive into the canvas or paper with unobtrusive touch. Colors are to smoothly or firmly conquer the surface without covering the air needed, so it breathes letting this way transparency be the music that appears between colors and my forms. I am looking to give to my work of art a voice to be listen in one's heart; and like a poem, the viewer will read across the space created, to then with freely intervals that textures and colors give away let the story of a life be upon one's eyes."

      bio: "Toby Penney is a southern artist working in paint, photography, printmaking & multiple sculpture media. She creates work accepting, even glorifying simple objects & fleeting moments. Penney holds a sculpture degree from Middle Tennessee State University. From 2005 until 2010 she held a Vitreography internship with Master Printmaker Judith O’Rourke at Harvey K. Littleton Studios, in Western North Carolina. She was honored when asked by the studio to photograph the process for the first Littleton sanctioned studio manual/ book about Vitreography. In the Fall of 2008 Toby was the guest artist in the printmaking department at Penland School of Craft, working with book/ paper artist Frank Brannon of Speak Easy Press. Find Penney’s paintings in private & corporate collections and museums. . Her images can be found on the cover of Professional Artist Magazine and Hellbent Magazine and featured in Numinous Magazine, Feroce Magazine, and Polonium II, a book by David Downs, among others. Usually you can find her sharing her studio with her enchanting 5 year old daughter. Find out more about Toby on social media via @TobyPenney or by contacting one of her representatives at Moberg Gallery in Des Moines, Iowa or Bill Lowe Gallery in Atlanta, Georgia."
